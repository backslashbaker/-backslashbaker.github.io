### For real where have I been?

So to cut straight to the point, life randomly decided it wanted to throw a curve-ball and knock me down. This resulted 
in me having to take a long break away from work and also programming. I'm in the middle of recovery so I'm not 100%
just yet, but I'm in a position to slowly start getting back into the swing of things and I thought this would be a
great opportunity to resume documenting my way through recovery and also my way back into programming. 

Although I'm not sure when I will return back to work, I don't want my skill set to get rusty and jeopardize my
development. With that being said I am going to be slowly doing some tutorials, code kata's and small projects to make 
sure my skills are kept lean for my return. 


### So what's next?

Although it won't be regular I will be using this space to document my way back into the game and sharing what I'm
learning. I'm thinking of starting a series called 'Dev Diaries.' This will act like a journal/ study recap where I 
share my day to day and more importantly what I've learned. I will also want to include a section around what 
I'm consuming that's not necessarily code related like movies, music and books, but I'm not 100% sure how that will 
work just yet. 

### In Conclusion

So that's where I have been and where I am headed. It would be very easy for me to look back at my first post on this 
website and kick myself whilst I'm down and feel like I'm starting all over again, but I'm not going to do that. My body
(more my brain) needed healing and I have dedicated time and energy into said healing and that can only make me a better
developer in the long run. 

What has taken and is taking a long time for me to master is that a lot of programming is all in the mindset especially 
when you're junior. All good things will come with time and hard work. It may sound childish, but I'm not in a race with
anyone. This is MY career and MY journey. I will take however bloody long it takes.
