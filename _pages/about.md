Hi my name is Derek Baker and I'm a Software Developer based in London. I'm currently working in the public sector building products and building solutions that leave a positive impact. When I'm not bumbling my way through writing code, i enjoy getting lost in the world of video games, comic books, photography and pasta. 

I'm always open for a chat so feel free to [email](mailto:hello@derekbaker.dev), [tweet](twitter.com/derekisadev) or a arrange a face to face chat.
